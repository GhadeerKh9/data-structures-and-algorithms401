## Approach & Efficiency

I used IntelliJ to test the code. Started by understanding the concept behind the binary search, coded in java, by creating a method that has a while and for loop, defined the middle index of the array and wrote the conditions based on it.

Big O
Space: O(1)
Time: O(log(n))
