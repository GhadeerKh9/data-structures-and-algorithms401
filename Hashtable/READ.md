# Hashtables


## Challenge
This challenge was to create a hashtable, add nodes to it, check if it contains specific things.

## Approach & Efficiency
We used while and for loops and created node class and and hashtable class.



# Challenge Summary

## Approach & Efficiency
#### Get all the letters to be in lower case
-  * put all the words in an array 
- *  loop through the array, check if it contains a comma and return it without the comma. 
-  * declare a counter and make it equal to  the value corresponded with the key
- * check if the value is null and return 0 and if there's a value, return it
- * add the words to the hashtable and assign the value corresponded with the key to be  1 after adding it to the table
- * loop over and over again and return the element where its value equals 1 before incrementing

## Solution
[my name my age]
counter = 0
value of my = 0
value of name = 0
value of my = 1

return ==> my
