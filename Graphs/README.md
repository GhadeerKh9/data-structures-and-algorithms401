# Graphs
Graphs are a data structure that has nodes called vertices and relations called edges.

## Challenge
This challenge was to add nodes, get nodes and get edges to a graph

## Approach & Efficiency
addding nodes and edges 

Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)



Getting nodes and edges
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)


## API
* Adding a node: This method adds a vertex to the graph.

* Adding an edge:  This method adds a new edge between two Vertices in the graph. 

* Getting nodes: This method returns all of the nodes in the graph.
* Getting Neighbours: This method returns the relations of some required vertices and returns a list.
